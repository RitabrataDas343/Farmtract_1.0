# The Farm Law 
➜ Overview of Contract Farming: Contract farming is the process of agricultural production carried out according to an agreement between unequal parties, companies, government bodies or individual entrepreneurs on one side and economically weaker farmers on the other which establishes conditions for the production and marketing of farm products.

➜ Why the Farmers Protesting:  The history of contract farming has many examples of non-payment by the companies making various excuses like substandard produce. A company is big and powerful and have legal team to make one sided contracts, also they have analysts to pick the price best for them.  There’re so many loopholes to make fraud with the farmers.

# Solution is Smart Contract
We will create a platform, Farmtract, to solve this problem where the farmers as well as who want to make contract can complete their agreement through smart contracting and cryptocurrency. 

# Workflow

* The  contract  will   run  till   the  specific  duration determined by both the parties. 

* When the farmer successfully harvests the crop, then as per specified terms and conditions, the smart contract will be executed, and the payment would be transferred to farmers account.
